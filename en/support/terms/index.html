<h1 id="terms-of-service">Terms of Service</h1>

<p>Please read these Terms and Conditions (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;, &ldquo;Terms and Conditions&rdquo;) carefully before using the <a href="http://1album.net">http://1album.net</a> website, the 1Album mobile application, and the 1Album Blackbox application (the &ldquo;Service&rdquo;) operated by 1 Digital Inc.

By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.</p>

<h3 id="subscriptions">Subscriptions</h3>

<p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis (&ldquo;Subscription(s)&rdquo;). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (&ldquo;Billing Cycle&rdquo;). Billing cycles are set on a monthly basis.
At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or 1 Digital Inc. cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting 1 Digital Inc. customer support team.
A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription.

Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
