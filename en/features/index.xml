      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a blackbox or can&amp;rsquo;t connect to it, 1Album app can still sychronize photos and videos between iPhone and iPad using the same peer-to-peer technology.  You can view photos shot by your iPhone from an iPad, and vise versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter which device you use, 1Album always shows you all photos and videos on all your devices, and done so without sending your photos to the cloud. Just like magic.&lt;/p&gt;
