      <description>&lt;p&gt;Storing any amount of full size photos and videos with 1Album is absolutely free, as opposed to most cloud services which charge you by the amount of data you have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our business is supported by displaying limited amount of Ads in 1Album app. You can pay a small monthly fee to make the Ads go away, but this is completely optional.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;1Album app and 1Album Blackbox do not need special network settings to connect. Our UDP-based peer-to-peer connection can pass through most NAT routers and cellular networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your computer can browse the web, 1Album app can connect to 1Album Blackbox on that computer. It&amp;rsquo;s that easy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You can link multiple 1Album Blackboxes to your account, and they synchronize with each other automatically. You can put them in different pyhysical locations to be even safer.  You will not loose your photos should any one of them fail.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Works Offline</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;1Album app works offline as well as online.  Short from viewing photos that have not been cached, you can almost do everything offline, such as organizing photos or posting comments.  The changes will synchronize back to 1Album Blackbox once you are online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, you can install 1Album Blackbox on a laptop and turn the blackbox on only when needed.  It does not need to  24x7.be running&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Works without Blackbox</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t have any blackboxes or can&amp;rsquo;t connect to one, 1Album app can still sychronize photos and videos between iPhone and iPad.  You can view photos on your iPhone from an iPad and vise versa.  It even works with more than two devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these are performed via peer-to-peer connections without sending your photos to the cloud. Just like magic.&lt;/p&gt;
