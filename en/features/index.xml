      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t have 1Album Blackbox set up, you can still use 1Album from your iPad to view photos and videos on your iPhone, and vise versa.  Powered by the same peer-to-peer technology, 1Album gives you a single album view to all photos and videos scattered around your devices, hence the name &amp;ldquo;1Album&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
